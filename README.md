## Quotex Trading Guide

Once you have downloaded and installed the Quotex app, you can start
trading binary options. Binary options are a type of financial
instrument that allow you to speculate on the price of an asset. You can
choose to buy a call option if you believe the price of the asset will
rise, or a put option if you believe the price will fall.

When you place a binary option trade, you are essentially betting on
whether the price of the asset will be above or below a certain price at
a certain time. If your prediction is correct, you will win the trade
and earn a profit. If your prediction is incorrect, you will lose the
trade and your investment.

There are a number of factors to consider when trading binary options,
such as the price of the asset, the volatility of the asset, and the
time to expiration of the option. It is important to do your research
and understand the risks involved before you start trading binary
options.

## Registration Process

To create a Quotex account, you will need to provide your name, email
address, and password. You can also choose to sign up with your Google
or Facebook account.

Once you have created an account, you will need to verify your email
address. You can do this by clicking on the link in the email that
Quotex will send you.

## How to Start Trading

To start trading binary options, you will need to deposit funds into
your Quotex account. You can do this using a variety of payment methods,
such as credit cards, debit cards, and e-wallets.

Once you have funded your account, you can choose the asset you want to
trade, the type of option you want to buy, and the amount of money you
want to invest.

Once you have placed a trade, you can track its progress in the "My
Trades" section of your Quotex account.
